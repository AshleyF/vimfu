# VimFu Curriculum

A complete curriculum for learning Vim/Neovim in **sub-60-second video lessons** (YouTube Shorts format).
Each lesson is a tiny, focused topic — one concept, one demo. Watch them in order to build up from
zero to fluency, or jump around once you're comfortable. After the foundational arc (Parts 1–4),
the lessons become daily "flash card" style — walk the keyboard, one key at a time.

## Part 1 — Survival (Lessons 1–15)

_Just enough to open a file, type something, save it, and get out alive._

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 001 | What Is Vim? | — | Why learn Vim? Modal editing philosophy. Normal mode is "normal." |
| 002 | Opening a File | `nvim hello.txt` | Launch Neovim, what you see, the empty buffer. |
| 003 | You're in Normal Mode | `Esc` | Normal mode is home base. Always return here after each thought. |
| 004 | Entering Insert Mode | `i` | Press `i` to insert text before the cursor. |
| 005 | Typing Text | — | You're in insert mode — just type normally. |
| 006 | Back to Normal Mode | `Esc` | Press Escape to leave insert mode. Make it a reflex. |
| 007 | Saving Your File | `:w` | Write (save) with colon-w-Enter. |
| 008 | Quitting Vim | `:q` | Quit with colon-q-Enter. The meme, solved. |
| 009 | Save and Quit | `:wq` `:x` `ZZ` | Three ways to save-and-quit. |
| 010 | Quit Without Saving | `:q!` `ZQ` | Discard changes and bail out. |
| 011 | Undo | `u` | Undo the last change. Press it again for more undos. |
| 012 | Redo | `Ctrl-R` | Redo what you just undid. |
| 013 | Moving: h j k l | `h` `j` `k` `l` | Left, down, up, right. Hands on home row. |
| 014 | Why Not Arrow Keys? | `←` `↓` `↑` `→` | They work, but your hands leave home row. Start breaking the habit. |
| 015 | The Escape Habit | `Esc` | After every thought: Escape. Normal mode is your resting state. |

## Part 15 — Visual Mode in Depth (Lessons 431–445)

> **Content note for book/website generation:** Visual mode is taught here
> because it's valuable for beginners (you can *see* the selection before
> acting) and genuinely useful for irregular or exploratory selections.
> However, when generating book chapters or web content from these lessons,
> **always mention that the direct operator + motion form is more efficient
> for simple cases.** For example, `dw` beats `vwd` — it's shorter and
> dot-repeatable. Visual mode shines for block selections, oddly-shaped
> regions, and cases where you need to verify the selection before
> committing. For everything else, prefer operator + motion. Many of our
> demos use visual mode to make the action visible on screen, but the
> viewer should understand that experienced Vim users treat visual mode as
> a fallback, not a default.

## Part 20 — Advanced (Lessons 600+)

_Deep cuts for power users. These lessons assume you're comfortable with everything above._

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 600 | Edit a Macro | `"ap` → edit → `"ayy` | Macros live in normal registers. Paste one with `"ap` to see the keystrokes, edit them as plain text, then yank the line back with `"ayy`. Now `@a` plays your hand-edited macro. |
| 601 | Useless Underscore | `_` → `:map _ i <Esc>` | The `_` key moves to the first non-blank character — same as `^`. With a count, `3_` goes down 2 lines to the first non-blank — but `+` already does that. So `_` is redundant. Remap it to something useful: `:map _ i <Esc>` inserts a space and returns to normal mode. Great for quick alignment without leaving normal mode. |

---

## Part 21 — Surround (Lessons 700–742)

_Tim Pope's surround.vim is one of the most popular Vim plugins ever written. Many editors and emulators (including the VS Code Vim extension) ship surround bindings by default. If you use Vim, you should know surround._

_**Installing in Neovim:** Neovim ships with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the most common plugin manager (it bootstraps itself automatically on first launch in many starter configs). Once you have lazy.nvim, add `{ "kylechui/nvim-surround", version = "*", event = "VeryLazy", config = function() require("nvim-surround").setup({}) end }` to your plugin list in `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`, then run `:Lazy sync` and you're done. Note: the Neovim port is [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround), not Tim Pope's original — the keybindings are the same (`ys`, `ds`, `cs`, `S` in visual mode)._

### What Is Surround?

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 700 | What Is Surround? | — | Surround.vim lets you add, change, and delete "surroundings" — parentheses, brackets, quotes, and HTML tags — in pairs. One of the most essential Vim plugins. |

### Deleting Surroundings (`ds`)

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 701 | Delete Surrounding Quotes | `ds"` | Remove the double quotes around the cursor. `ds'` and `` ds` `` work for single quotes and backticks. |
| 702 | Delete Surrounding Parentheses | `ds)` or `dsb` | Remove the parentheses around the cursor. `b` is an alias for `)`. |
| 703 | Delete Surrounding Brackets | `ds]` or `dsr` | Remove the square brackets around the cursor. `r` is an alias for `]`. |
| 704 | Delete Surrounding Braces | `ds}` or `dsB` | Remove the curly braces around the cursor. `B` is an alias for `}`. |
| 705 | Delete Surrounding Angle Brackets | `ds>` or `dsa` | Remove the angle brackets around the cursor. `a` is an alias for `>`. |
| 706 | Delete Surrounding Tags | `dst` | Remove the HTML/XML tag pair around the cursor. Handles `<div>`, `<em>`, `<p class="x">`, etc. |
| 707 | Delete — Opening Mark Trims Space | `ds(` vs `ds)` | Using the opening mark (`ds(`, `ds{`, `ds[`) also removes inner whitespace. `ds)` leaves spaces intact. Compare: `ds(` on `( hello )` → `hello`; `ds)` → ` hello `. |
| 708 | Delete Arbitrary Surroundings | `ds\|` `ds*` `ds_` | Any punctuation character that isn't a paired bracket works symmetrically. `ds\|` removes pipes, `ds*` removes asterisks. Works with `/`, `_`, `~`, etc. |
| 709 | Delete C-Style Comments | `ds/` | Specifically removes `/* ... */` comment delimiters. The `/` target is a special case that understands C-style block comments. |
| 710 | Delete with Count | `2ds)` `2dst` | A count targets the Nth enclosing pair. `2ds)` deletes the second outer set of parentheses. `2dst` deletes the second enclosing tag. |

### Changing Surroundings (`cs`)

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 711 | Change Quotes | `cs"'` | Change double quotes to single quotes. Works with any quote pair as source or destination. |
| 712 | Change Brackets to Parens | `cs])` | Change square brackets to parentheses. Using a closing mark as replacement gives no extra space. |
| 713 | Change — Add Inner Space | `cs){` or `cs)[` | Using an opening mark as the *replacement* (`{`, `[`, `(`) adds a space inside: `{ text }`. |
| 714 | Change — Trim Inner Space | `cs({` | Using an opening mark as the *target* trims existing inner whitespace before applying the new surround. `cs(}` on `( hello )` → `{hello}`. |
| 715 | Change to HTML Tag | `cs"<em>` | Change quotes to an HTML tag pair. Vim prompts for the tag name — you can include attributes. |
| 716 | Change Tag to Tag | `cst<div>` | Change the nearest HTML/XML tag to a different tag. Attributes on the old tag are preserved unless you end your input with `>`. |
| 717 | Change Tag to Quote | `cst"` | Change an HTML tag pair to double quotes. `t` targets the innermost tag. |
| 718 | Change on Separate Lines | `cS"(` | Like `cs`, but places the surrounded text on its own indented line. |
| 719 | Change with Word Target | `cswb` `csWB` | The `w`, `W`, and `s` targets act as shortcuts. `cswb` is roughly equivalent to `ysiwb` — it treats the word as the "old surround" and wraps it. |

### Adding Surroundings (`ys`)

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 720 | Surround a Word | `ysiw)` | Wrap the word under the cursor in parentheses. `ys` = "you surround", then a motion or text-object, then the replacement character. |
| 721 | Surround with Space | `ysiw(` or `ysiw{` or `ysiw[` | Using an opening mark adds a space inside: `( word )`, `{ word }`, `[ word ]`. Use closing marks for no space. |
| 722 | Surround a WORD | `ysaW}` | Wrap a WORD (whitespace-delimited) in braces. Any text object works: `ysas)` for a sentence, `ysap}` for a paragraph. |
| 723 | Surround with Motion | `ys$"` `ysf."` `yst,)` | Any Vim motion works as the first argument. `ys$"` wraps to end of line in quotes, `ysf."` wraps up to the next period. |
| 724 | Surround the Whole Line | `yss)` or `yssb` | Wrap the entire current line in parentheses, ignoring leading whitespace. `yss` is a special double-key shortcut like `dd` or `yy`. |
| 725 | Surround with Tag | `ysiw<em>` | Wrap a word in an HTML/XML tag. Vim prompts for the tag — you can include attributes like `<div class="x">`. |
| 726 | Surround with Tag on Separate Lines | `ysiw<C-T>` | Like surrounding with a tag, but `<C-T>` places the opening and closing tags on their own lines with the content indented. |
| 727 | Surround with Self-Closing Tag | `ysiw<br/>` | End the tag with `/` to produce a self-closing tag like `<br />` with no closing pair. |
| 728 | Surround with Function Call | `ysiwfprint↵` | Wrap a word in a function call: `print(word)`. `f` prompts for the function name and wraps in `name(...)`. |
| 729 | Surround with Function — Extra Space | `ysiwFprint↵` | Like `f`, but `F` adds spaces inside the parentheses: `print( word )`. |
| 730 | Surround — Function Inside Parens | `ysiw<C-f>print↵` | Inverted function style: `(print word)`. The function name goes inside the parentheses. Useful for Lisp-like syntax. |
| 731 | Surround with Arbitrary Character | `ysiw/` `ysiw\|` | Any undefined, non-alphabetic character wraps symmetrically. `ysiw/` → `/word/`, `ysiw\|` → `\|word\|`. Great for Markdown emphasis, Ruby symbols, etc. |
| 732 | Surround with Code Block | `ysiw<C-]>` | Wraps in braces on separate lines — `{` and `}` each on their own line with the content indented. Perfect for C-style code blocks. (`<C-]>` is really `<C-}>`.) |
| 733 | Surround with LaTeX Environment | `ysiwl` or `ysiw\` | Prompts for an environment name and wraps in `\begin{env}...\end{env}`. Both `l` and `\` trigger the LaTeX prompt. |
| 734 | Surround — Leading Space Only | `ysiws` | The `s` replacement adds a leading space but no trailing space. Useful for: `csbs` removes parentheses from a function call like `func(x)` → `func x`. |
| 735 | Surround on Separate Lines | `ySiw(` | Like `ys`, but `yS` indents the surrounded text and places it on its own line between the surround characters. |
| 736 | Surround Entire Line on Separate Lines | `ySS{` | Wrap the current line in braces, each on a new line with proper indentation. Perfect for wrapping a statement in a block. |

### Visual Mode Surround (`S` / `gS`)

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 737 | Visual Surround — Characterwise | `v` → select → `S)` | In characterwise visual mode, `S` then a character wraps just the selection. |
| 738 | Visual Surround — Linewise | `V` → select → `S<p>` | In linewise visual mode, `S` places the surroundings on separate lines with the content indented. |
| 739 | Visual Surround — Blockwise | `Ctrl-V` → select → `S"` | In blockwise visual mode, each line of the selection is individually surrounded. |
| 740 | Visual `gS` | `gS` | In linewise visual mode, `gS` suppresses the automatic indenting that `S` does. In blockwise visual mode, `gS` enables surrounding past the end of the line (with `virtualedit`). |

### Insert Mode Surround

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 741 | Insert Mode Surround | `<C-G>s` or `<C-S>` | In insert mode, press `<C-G>s` (or `<C-S>` if your terminal supports it) then a character. The surroundings are inserted and the cursor is placed between them. |
| 742 | Insert Mode Surround on Separate Lines | `<C-G>S` | Like `<C-G>s`, but the prefix, cursor, and suffix are placed on three separate lines. Pressing `<C-S>` or `Enter` a second time (before the replacement char) also triggers multi-line mode. |

# Part 22 — Ex Commands

> These lessons cover the ex (command-line) commands.` Lessons are
> numbered starting at **0800** to avoid conflicts with existing ranges.

## Understanding the Command Line

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 800 | What Is the Command Line? | `:` | Pressing `:` in normal mode opens the command line at the bottom of the screen. This is where you type ex commands. |
| 801 | Running a Command | `:` … `Enter` | After typing a command, press Enter to execute it. The result appears in the buffer or status line. |
| 802 | Canceling a Command | `:` … `Escape` | Press Escape to cancel a command you've started typing without executing it. |
| 803 | Command History | `:` `↑` `↓` | Press `:` then use the up/down arrow keys to recall previous commands. |

## Range Addressing

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 804 | Go to a Line Number | `:{number}` | Typing a number as a command jumps the cursor to that line. `:10` goes to line 10. |
| 805 | The Current Line `.` | `:.` | A dot represents the current line. `:.d` deletes the current line. Most commands default to `.` if no range is given. |
| 806 | The Last Line `$` | `:$` | The dollar sign represents the last line of the file. `:$` jumps to the end. |
| 807 | A Range of Lines | `:{from},{to}` | Two line addresses separated by a comma define a range. `:3,7d` deletes lines 3 through 7. |
| 808 | The Entire File `%` | `:%` | The percent sign is shorthand for `1,$` — the entire file. `:%d` deletes everything. |
| 809 | Visual Range `'<,'>` | `:'<,'>` | After making a visual selection and pressing `:`, Vim inserts `'<,'>` automatically — the range of the selection. |
| 810 | Mark-Based Ranges | `:'a,'b` | Use marks as range endpoints. `:'a,'b d` deletes from mark `a` to mark `b`. |
| 811 | Offsets in Ranges | `:.+2` `.,.+5` | Add `+N` or `-N` to any address. `:.,.+5d` deletes from the current line through 5 lines below. |
| 812 | Combining Range Forms | `:'{mark},$` | Mix and match — mark to end of file, line number to mark, current line plus offset to last line, etc. |

## File Operations

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 813 | `:w` — Write (Save) | `:w` | Save the current buffer to disk. The status line confirms the write. |
| 814 | `:w {file}` — Write to a File | `:w {file}` | Save to a different filename without switching buffers. The original file remains open. |
| 815 | `:wq` — Write and Quit | `:wq` | Save and close the editor. The most common exit command. |
| 816 | `:x` — Write and Quit (Smart) | `:x` | Like `:wq` but only writes if changes were made. Avoids unnecessary file touches. |
| 817 | `:q` — Quit | `:q` | Quit the editor. Fails if there are unsaved changes — Vim protects your work. |
| 818 | `:q!` — Force Quit | `:q!` | Quit discarding all unsaved changes. The `!` means "I know what I'm doing." |
| 819 | `:e {file}` — Edit a File | `:e {file}` | Open a different file for editing. Fails if current buffer has unsaved changes. |
| 820 | `:e!` — Revert to Saved | `:e!` | Discard all changes and reload the file from disk. A fresh start. |
| 821 | `:sav {file}` — Save As | `:sav {file}` | Save the buffer to a new filename AND switch to editing the new file. Unlike `:w {file}` which keeps the original. |
| 822 | `:r {file}` — Read a File | `:r {file}` | Insert the contents of another file below the cursor line. |
| 823 | `:r !{cmd}` — Read Shell Output | `:r !{cmd}` | Run a shell command and insert its output below the cursor. `:r !date` inserts today's date. |

## Line Editing Commands

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 824 | `:[range]d` — Delete Lines | `:3d` `:5,10d` | Delete one or more lines. Without a range, deletes the current line. Deleted text goes to the unnamed register. |
| 825 | `:[range]d {reg}` — Delete into Register | `:3d a` | Delete lines and store them in a named register. `:5,10d b` stores the block in register `b`. |
| 826 | `:[range]y` — Yank (Copy) Lines | `:3y` `:5,10y` | Yank (copy) lines without deleting them. Text goes to the unnamed register. |
| 827 | `:[range]y {reg}` — Yank into Register | `:3y a` | Yank lines into a named register. Use capital letters to append: `:3y A` appends to register `a`. |
| 828 | `:[range]m {address}` — Move Lines | `:3m 7` `:5,10m $` | Move lines to after the target address. `:3m 0` moves line 3 to the very top. |
| 829 | `:[range]co {address}` — Copy Lines | `:3co 7` `:5,10co $` | Copy (duplicate) lines to after the target address. `:co` and `:t` are synonyms. |
| 830 | `:[range]t {address}` — Copy (Synonym) | `:3t 7` `:t$` | Same as `:co`. The `t` stands for "to". Shorter to type and very common in practice. |
| 831 | `:[range]j` — Join Lines | `:3,5j` `:%j` | Join a range of lines into one, adding spaces between. `:%j` joins the entire file into one line. |
| 832 | `:pu {reg}` — Put Register | `:pu a` `:pu` | Insert the contents of a register below the current line. Without a register, puts the unnamed register. |
| 833 | `:[range]sort` — Sort Lines | `:%sort` `:3,10sort` | Sort lines alphabetically. Works on a range or the whole file. |
| 834 | `:[range]sort!` — Reverse Sort | `:%sort!` | Sort in reverse (descending) order. The `!` flips the sort direction. |
| 835 | `:[range]sort` Options | `:sort n` `:sort u` `:sort i` | Flags: `n` = numeric sort, `u` = remove duplicates, `i` = ignore case. Combine them: `:sort niu`. |

## Substitution (Search and Replace)

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 836 | `:s/old/new/` — Substitute on Line | `:s/old/new/` | Replace the first occurrence of "old" with "new" on the current line. |
| 837 | `:s` Flag `g` — All on Line | `:s/old/new/g` | The `g` flag replaces ALL occurrences on the line, not just the first. |
| 838 | `:s` Flag `i` — Case Insensitive | `:s/old/new/gi` | The `i` flag ignores case when matching. Combine with `g` for all matches. |
| 839 | `:s` Flag `c` — Confirm Each | `:s/old/new/gc` | The `c` flag asks for confirmation before each replacement. `y`/`n`/`a`/`q`/`l` to respond. |
| 840 | `:s` Flag `n` — Count Only | `:s/old/new/gn` | The `n` flag counts matches without replacing. Great for checking how many matches exist. |
| 841 | `:%s/old/new/g` — Whole File | `:%s/old/new/g` | Use `%` to substitute across the entire file. The most common form of search-and-replace. |
| 842 | `:'<,'>s` — Substitute in Selection | `:'<,'>s/old/new/g` | After a visual selection, `:s` operates only within the selected lines. |
| 843 | `:[range]s` — Substitute in Range | `:5,20s/old/new/g` | Any range works — line numbers, marks, offsets. `:.,+5s/old/new/g` replaces from here through 5 lines down. |
| 844 | `:noh` — Clear Search Highlighting | `:noh` | After a search or `:s`, highlighted matches can be distracting. `:noh` clears them until the next search. |

## Display and Information Commands

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 845 | `:marks` — Show All Marks | `:marks` | Display a table of all active marks — their name, line number, column, and the text on that line. |
| 846 | `:reg` — Show All Registers | `:reg` | Display the contents of all registers — unnamed, numbered, named, small delete, search, and more. Also available as `:di` (`:display`). |
| 847 | `:[range]p` — Print Lines | `:3p` `:5,10p` | Print (display) lines in the status area. Without a range, prints the current line. The cursor moves to the last printed line. |
| 848 | `:[range]nu` — Print with Line Numbers | `:3nu` `:5,10nu` | Like `:p` but each line is prefixed with its line number. Also available as `:#`. |
| 849 | `:=` — Show Line Count | `:=` | Without a range, shows the total number of lines in the file. |
| 850 | `:{range}=` — Show Line Number | `:.=` `:$=` | With an address, shows the line number of that address. `:.=` shows the current line number, `:$=` shows the last. |
| 851 | `:jumps` — Show Jump List | `:jumps` | Display the jump list — a history of cursor positions you've jumped between. Navigate with `Ctrl-O` (back) and `Ctrl-I` / `Tab` (forward). |

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 853 | `:[range]>` — Indent Lines | `:3>` `:5,10>` | Shift lines right by one `shiftwidth`. Works on a single line or a range. |
| 854 | `:[range]<` — Dedent Lines | `:3<` `:5,10<` | Shift lines left by one `shiftwidth`. Removes leading whitespace. |
| 855 | Visual Selection + `:>` / `:<` | `:'<,'>>`  `:'<,'><` | Select lines visually, then `:>` or `:<` to indent or dedent just the selection. |
| 856 | Multiple Shifts | `:3>>` `:5,10<<<` | Repeat `>` or `<` to shift by multiple `shiftwidth` units. `:>>` shifts right twice. |

## Multi-Line Power Commands

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 857 | `:[range]norm {keys}` — Normal on Lines | `:%norm A;` | Execute normal-mode keystrokes on every line in the range. `:%norm A;` appends a semicolon to every line. |
| 858 | `:norm` with Insert Mode | `:%norm I# ` | Normal commands can enter insert mode. `:%norm I# ` comments out every line (inserts `# ` at the start). |
| 859 | `:norm` on a Range | `:5,10norm dd` | Limit `:norm` to specific lines. `:5,10norm dd` deletes lines 5 through 10 one by one. |
| 860 | `:g/{pattern}/{cmd}` — Global | `:g/TODO/d` | Execute an ex command on every line matching a pattern. `:g/TODO/d` deletes all lines containing "TODO". |
| 861 | `:g` with `:d` — Delete Matches | `:g/^$/d` | A classic: `:g/^$/d` deletes all blank lines. The pattern is a regular expression. |
| 862 | `:g` with `:m` — Collect Matches | `:g/import/m 0` | Move all matching lines somewhere. `:g/import/m 0` collects all imports at the top of the file. |
| 863 | `:g` with `:norm` — Normal on Matches | `:g/TODO/norm 0x` | Combine `:g` and `:norm` for surgical strikes. Only lines matching the pattern get the keystrokes. |
| 864 | `:g` with `:s` — Substitute on Matches | `:g/class/s/old/new/g` | Run `:s` only on lines matching a different pattern. Two-stage filtering. |
| 865 | `:v/{pattern}/{cmd}` — Inverse Global | `:v/keep/d` | The opposite of `:g` — acts on lines that do NOT match. `:v/keep/d` deletes every line that doesn't contain "keep". |
| 866 | `:v` with `:d` — Keep Only Matches | `:v/important/d` | A quick way to filter a file down to only the lines you care about. |

## Settings (`:set`)

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 867 | `:set number` — Line Numbers | `:set number` `:set nu` | Show absolute line numbers in the gutter. `:set nonumber` (or `:set nonu`) to turn off. |
| 868 | `:set relativenumber` — Relative Numbers | `:set relativenumber` `:set rnu` | Show line numbers relative to the cursor. Great for quick `5j` / `12k` jumps. `:set nornu` to disable. |
| 869 | `:set hlsearch` — Highlight Search | `:set hlsearch` `:set hls` | Highlight all matches for the current search pattern. `:set nohlsearch` to disable. Use `:noh` to clear temporarily. |
| 870 | `:set incsearch` — Incremental Search | `:set incsearch` `:set is` | Show matches in real-time as you type a search pattern. `:set noincsearch` to disable. |
| 871 | `:set ignorecase` — Case Insensitive | `:set ignorecase` `:set ic` | Make searches case-insensitive by default. `:set noignorecase` to restore case sensitivity. |
| 872 | `:set smartcase` — Smart Case | `:set smartcase` `:set scs` | When `ignorecase` is on, typing an uppercase letter makes that search case-sensitive again. Best used with `ignorecase`. |
| 873 | `:set scrolloff` — Scroll Margin | `:set scrolloff=5` `:set so=5` | Keep at least N lines visible above and below the cursor when scrolling. Prevents the cursor from touching the edge. |
| 874 | `:set expandtab` / `tabstop` / `shiftwidth` | `:set et` `:set ts=4` `:set sw=4` | Control tab behavior. `expandtab` inserts spaces instead of tabs. `tabstop` sets tab display width. `shiftwidth` sets indent width for `>` / `<`. |
| 875 | `:set autoindent` — Auto Indent | `:set autoindent` `:set ai` | New lines inherit the indentation of the previous line. `:set noautoindent` to disable. |
| 876 | `:set cursorline` — Highlight Current Line | `:set cursorline` `:set cul` | Highlight the entire line the cursor is on. Makes it easy to spot your position. `:set nocursorline` to disable. |
| 877 | Toggling Settings with `no` Prefix | `:set noX` | Any boolean setting can be turned off by prefixing `no`. `:set number` → `:set nonumber`. Works with all aliases too: `:set nonu`. |
| 878 | Querying Settings with `?` | `:set number?` `:set ts?` | Append `?` to check a setting's current value without changing it. Boolean settings show `number` or `nonumber`. Numeric settings show the value. |
| 879 | Setting Numeric Values with `=` | `:set scrolloff=3` `:set ts=2` | Numeric settings use `=` to assign a value. `:set sw=4` sets shiftwidth to 4. |

## Shell Commands

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 880 | `:!{cmd}` — Run Shell Command | `:!ls` `:!python %` | Execute an external shell command. Output is displayed but doesn't affect the buffer. Press Enter to return. |

## Putting It All Together

| #   | Title | Keys | Description |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| 881 | Recipe: Delete a Block of Lines | `:5,15d` | Select a range and delete. Faster than visual mode for known line numbers. |
| 882 | Recipe: Duplicate a Section | `:5,15t 20` | Copy a block of lines to another location. Great for duplicating functions or blocks. |
| 883 | Recipe: Move Code Around | `:5,15m 30` | Reorganize code by moving line ranges. `:m 0` moves to the top, `:m $` to the bottom. |
| 884 | Recipe: Mass Rename | `:%s/oldName/newName/g` | Rename a variable or function across the entire file in one command. |
| 885 | Recipe: Delete All Comments | `:g/^#/d` `:g/^\/\//d` | Use `:g` with a comment pattern to strip all comments from a file. |
| 886 | Recipe: Add to Every Line | `:%norm A;` | Append a semicolon (or anything) to every line. Change `A` to `I` to prepend instead. |
| 887 | Recipe: Number All Lines | `:%norm I\<C-r>=line('.').' '\<CR>` | Advanced: use `:norm` with expression register to prepend line numbers. |
| 888 | Recipe: Sort and Deduplicate | `:%sort u` | Sort all lines and remove duplicates in one command. |
| 889 | Recipe: Reverse File Order | `:g/^/m 0` | A classic trick — `:g/^/m 0` matches every line and moves it to line 0, effectively reversing the file. |
| 890 | Recipe: Extract Matching Lines | `:v/pattern/d` | Keep only lines matching a pattern — delete everything else. Quick log filtering. |
| 891 | Recipe: Comment Out a Range | `:5,15norm I# ` | Add comment characters to a range of lines using `:norm`. |
| 892 | Recipe: Indent a Block | `:5,15>` | Indent a range from the command line — no visual mode needed. |
| 893 | Recipe: Yank to Named Register | `:5,15y a` | Yank a block into register `a` from the command line. Paste with `"ap` anywhere. |
| 894 | Recipe: Sort Imports | `:1,10sort` | Sort just the import lines at the top of a file. Use line numbers or marks. |
| 895 | Recipe: Clean Trailing Whitespace | `:%s/\s\+$//g` | Remove trailing whitespace from every line. A common cleanup task. |

|---------|----------|--------|
| `h` | `Ctrl-H`, `BS`, `←` | Left |
| `l` | `Space`, `→` | Right |
| `k` | `Ctrl-P`, `↑` | Up |
| `j` | `Ctrl-J`, `Ctrl-N`, `↓`, `NL` | Down |
| `C` | `c$` | Change to end |
| `D` | `d$` | Delete to end |
| `S` | `cc` | Substitute line |
| `Y` | `yy` | Yank line |
| `+` | `Ctrl-M`, `Enter` | Next line start |
| `0` | `Home` | First column |
| `$` | `End` | End of line |
| `x` | `Del` | Delete char |
| `u` | `Undo` | Undo |
| `Ctrl-F` | `PageDown`, `Shift-Down` | Page forward |
| `Ctrl-B` | `PageUp`, `Shift-Up` | Page backward |
| `Esc` | `Ctrl-[` | Escape |

## Appendix B — The Vim Grammar

Vim commands follow a composable grammar:

```
[count] [register] operator [count] motion/text-object
```

**Operators** (verbs): `d` `c` `y` `>` `<` `=` `g~` `gu` `gU` `!` `gq` `gw` `g?` `g@`

**Motions** (where): `w` `b` `e` `ge` `W` `B` `E` `0` `^` `$` `f` `t` `F` `T` `{` `}` `(` `)` `gg` `G` `H` `M` `L` `/` `?` `n` `N` `%` etc.

**Text Objects** (what): `iw` `aw` `iW` `aW` `is` `as` `ip` `ap` `i"` `a"` `i'` `a'` `` i` `` `` a` `` `i(` `a(` `i{` `a{` `i[` `a[` `i<` `a<` `it` `at`

Any operator × any motion/text-object = a command. This is why Vim scales — learn one new operator and it works with every motion you know, and vice versa.

## Appendix D — Surround Plugin

The Surround plugin (`vim-surround` / `nvim-surround`) is arguably the most universally useful
Vim plugin. It's built into many emulators (VS Code Vim, IdeaVim, etc.) and may deserve its own
mini-series of lessons. Consider adding these as a **Part 20** or bonus section.

| Action | Keys | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Surround word with `"` | `ysiw"` | You Surround Inner Word with `"`. |
| Surround visual selection | `viwS"` | Visual select a word, then `S"` to wrap in quotes. |
| Change surround | `cs'"` | Change surrounding `'` to `"`. |
| Delete surround | `ds"` | Delete surrounding `"`. |
| Surround with tag | `ysiw<em>` | Surround word with `<em>...</em>`. |
| Change tag | `cst<div>` | Change surrounding tag to `<div>`. |
| Surround line | `yss"` | Surround the entire line with `"`. |
| Surround with parens | `ysiw)` or `ysiw(` | `)` = no spaces, `(` = with spaces inside. |

> **Note**: Neovim does _not_ include surround by default. Install `kylechui/nvim-surround` or
> `tpope/vim-surround`. However, VS Code's Vim extension includes surround support out of the box.

## Appendix E — Original Handwritten Notes

_Preserved from the original Curriculum.md — personal observations and tips worth keeping._

### Visual Mode — Special Behavior of Insert Keys

In Visual mode, the "insert" keys (`i`, `a`, `o`, `O`) have different meanings than in Normal mode:
- `i` and `a` are **text-object modifiers** (e.g., `viw` = visual-select inner word), _not_ insert commands
- `o` switches the cursor to the **other end** of the selection (extend either direction)
- `O` in block-visual mode switches to the **other corner** horizontally
- `I` and `A` in block-visual mode insert/append on **every line** of the block
- `c` / `s` / `r` / `R` all operate on the selection (change, substitute, replace)

### Practical Vim Tips

From _Practical Vim_ by Drew Neil:

- `q:` and `q/` open editable command/search history windows — much better than pressing `↑` repeatedly
- Map `<C-p>` and `<C-n>` on the command line to filter history by prefix:
  ```vim
  cnoremap <C-p> <Up>
  cnoremap <C-n> <Down>
  ```
- Increase command-line history: `:set history=200`
- Power pattern — search with `*`, change the word, then apply globally:
  `*cwfoo<Esc>` then `:%s//<C-r><C-w>/g` (empty pattern reuses last search)
- `Y` should be `y$` for consistency with `C` and `D` — add `:map Y y$` to your config

### Motion Classification (from Vim docs)

Vim motions are categorized as **exclusive** or **inclusive**, which affects which characters
an operator acts on:

- **Inclusive** (`e`, `f`, `t`, `;`, `,`, `$`, `%`, `G`, `H`, `L`, `M`, etc.) — the last
  character of the motion _is_ included in the operation
- **Exclusive** (`w`, `b`, `h`, `l`, `0`, `^`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `/`, `?`, etc.) — the
  last character is _not_ included
- **Linewise** (`j`, `k`, `G`, `H`, `L`, `M`, `+`, `-`, `_`, `dd`, `cc`, etc.) — entire
  lines are affected regardless of cursor column

This matters when you do things like `dw` (doesn't grab the space after) vs `de` (grabs the
last letter) — and explains some surprising behaviors.

### The Vimtutor Lesson Order

For reference, the official `vimtutor` teaches concepts in this order:
`hjkl` → `Esc :q!` → `x` → `i Esc` → `A` → `:wq` → `dw` → `d$` → `d{motion}` →
`2w 3e 0` → `d[count]{motion}` → `dd 2dd` → `u U Ctrl-R` → `p` → `r{char}` → `ce` →
`c[count]{motion}` → `Ctrl-G G gg` → `/ ? n N Ctrl-O Ctrl-I` → `%` → `:s/old/new/[g][c]` →
`:!{cmd}` → `:w` → `v{motion}` → `:r` → `o O` → `a` → `R` → `y yw` → `:set ic hls is` →
help / vimrc / completion

### How to Learn Vim (Philosophy)

- **Normal mode is "normal."** You spend most of your time _reading_ and _navigating_ code,
  not inserting. Get comfortable living in Normal mode.
- **Always hit `Esc` after each thought.** Think of insert mode as a brief excursion.
- **Keys, front right pocket** (except when driving). Carry a cheat sheet on your phone.
- **Learn in this order:**
  1. Lowercase alphabet (except `g` and `z` — those are prefix keys)
  2. Symbols
  3. Uppercase alphabet
  4. Control keys
  5. Insert mode tricks
- **Go "cold turkey" as soon as you're comfortable enough.** Basic motions, visual mode,
  delete, copy/paste — that's enough to be productive. Then force yourself.
- **Hands off the mouse** (never use "select mode")
- **Hands off the arrows** → then eventually, less reliance on `hjkl` too
- **More thinking, less mindless keystrokes** — like the Petrus method for Rubik's cube:
  think ahead, plan your moves, execute efficiently

## Appendix F — Simulator Coverage

The VimFu simulator supports a curated subset of Vim, tmux, and shell features — enough to
practice the entire foundational curriculum (Parts 1–4) and the tmux section (Part 19), plus
many features from the reference parts. Features not in the simulator can be practiced in
real Neovim.

### Fully Supported in Simulator

- **Parts 1–3** (Lessons 1–90): All features except `Ctrl-V` block visual mode (Lessons 66–67)
- **Part 4** (Lessons 91–135): All features except global marks (`m{A-Z}`), auto-indent (`=`),
  system clipboard (`"+`, `"*`), and nvim window splits (`:sp`, `:vs`, `Ctrl-W`). Use tmux
  panes instead of nvim splits! Special marks (`` '. `` `` `' `` `< `>`), append registers
  (`"A-Z`), small delete (`"-`), numbered registers (`"0`–`"9`), and `:reg` are now supported.
- **Part 19** (Lessons 501–545): All tmux and shell features fully supported
- **Part 22** (Lessons 800–895): All ex commands fully supported in the simulator — ranges,
  `:d`, `:y`, `:m`, `:co`/`:t`, `:j`, `:pu`, `:sort`, `:s` (with `g`/`i`/`c`/`n` flags),
  `:norm`, `:g`, `:v`, `:marks`, `:reg`, `:p`/`:nu`/`:#`, `:=`, `:jumps`, `:changes`,
  `:[range]>`, `:[range]<`, `:set` (10 options), `:!`, and all file operations.
